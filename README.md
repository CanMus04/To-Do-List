# To-Do List

This is a simple command-line to-do list application built in Python. It allows users to add tasks, mark them as completed, delete them, and view all the tasks in their list.

## About the Project

At first, I thought creating a basic to-do list would be a quick and easy project, but it turned out to be a bit more challenging than expected. One of the most difficult parts was ensuring that the tasks were handled properlyâ€”whether it was updating their completion status, ensuring valid input for task deletion, or making sure the task list was displayed in an organized and user-friendly way. 

There were several improvements I made throughout the process, like ensuring that invalid user inputs (such as entering a non-numeric value when selecting a task) were handled gracefully. I also had to manage the internal structure of the tasks carefully, ensuring that each task had a title and a completion status.

I learned a lot about list manipulation, error handling, and structuring a simple command-line application. It was a great learning experience, and I'm happy with the result!

### Features
- Add new tasks with a title.
- Mark tasks as completed with a checkmark.
- Delete tasks from the list.
- View all tasks with their current status.
- Graceful error handling for invalid inputs.

## How It Works

1. The user can choose to view all tasks, add a new task, mark a task as completed, delete a task, or quit the application.
2. When a task is marked as completed, it shows a checkmark next to the task title.
3. When a task is deleted, it is removed from the list.
4. If the user enters an invalid input, the program will display an error message and prompt the user again.

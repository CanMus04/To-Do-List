# To-Do List

This is a simple command-line to-do list application built in Python. It allows users to add tasks, mark them as completed, delete them, and view all the tasks in their list.

## About the Project

Honestly, this project turned out to be much harder than I anticipated. Although the concept of a to-do list seemed simple at first, it quickly became more complicated as I tried to implement the various features, especially the task management part (adding, deleting, completing tasks). 

To be completely transparent, I ended up following a tutorial and largely copying the code. I didn’t feel like I learned much from this project itself, as I mostly focused on adapting the code from the tutorial to fit my needs. 

The most challenging part was ensuring everything worked smoothly when interacting with the user. I also struggled a bit with error handling, like when users entered invalid inputs. But overall, I wasn’t too involved in coming up with the logic myself—this was more about getting things to work by following instructions.

### Features
- Add new tasks with a title.
- Mark tasks as completed with a checkmark.
- Delete tasks from the list.
- View all tasks with their current status.
- Graceful error handling for invalid inputs.

## How It Works

1. The user can choose to view all tasks, add a new task, mark a task as completed, delete a task, or quit the application.
2. When a task is marked as completed, it shows a checkmark next to the task title.
3. When a task is deleted, it is removed from the list.
4. If the user enters an invalid input, the program will display an error message and prompt the user again.
